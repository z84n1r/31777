ASSIGNMENT   1:   USER   EXPERIENCE JOURNALS 
1.      OVERVIEWOur user experiences with digital products are affected by many factors.      So, if   we wish to      design digital solutions that can potentially offer more desirable user experiences,   we   must   first understand what these factors are and how they affect our user   experience.In this assignment, you will submit two (2)   journal entries. Each   journal   entry will   focus   on your use of   a prescribed digital product in a real-life activity. Your task is to   document   and      later, reflect and analyse your interactions as well as experiences   with   each   digital product.      Each   journal   entry   will   assess   your   ability   to:
•         clearly and thoroughly identify the different factors involved in the   interaction
•         explain how and why each factor are involved in   shaping your   overall user   experience
2.      AIMS   OF   THE   ASSIGNMENT
The assignment assesses the student’s   ability to:
1.       Identify the factors involved and   explain how they   affect the unfolding   experience
2.       Describe the unfolding experience holistically
3.       Identify and describe the quality of   the   experience
3.      REQUIREMENTS
Complete two   journal entries using the template provided. The template is created to guide you   in   your   description   and   analysis   of   the   unfolding   user   experience.
4.      FOCUS   OF   THE   TWO   JOURNALS
A.       Journal   1: Using   Miro   to   create a   Persona
Background: this journal requires you to report and reflect   on   your   user   experience   of   using a digital product that you are   somewhat   familiar with
i.                   The interaction: Creating   a   Persona   using   Miro   (@   miro.com)
You interviewed of some of   your fellow students   in   Tutorial   Week   1   and   Week   2.
You were asked to create a   Persona based   on   each   of   your   interview   data.   Now,   for   this assignment,choose one set of interview data   and   create   a   Persona   using   Miro.
i. Advice: You should pre-prepare   the   relevant   information   required   for   the   Persona   before starting the activity for this journal   (i.e. before you   start   creating your
Persona   on   Miro)
ii. The task:   Document   your interactions   and   experiences   of using   Miro to   create
your   Persona onto the journal template. Attach the   Persona to the journal entry   for   your submission.
iii. Submission date:   before   your   tutorial   on   Week   4
B.       Journal   2:   Conducting a team meeting   using   Zoom
Background: this journal requires you to report/reflect on your   user   experience   of a   digital product that you are   familiar with but involves   a   strong   social   aspect
i. The interaction 
Make a video call with your camera on with a group of your classmates (at   least   2   others) from   this   subject   using   Zoom. The   aim   of   the   callisto   share   and   learn about each other’s commuting experiences   or   to   share your   current   design ideas.   Everyone must also take turns to use share screen to   share experiences/ideas.   Make sure that one person in the meeting is recording the meeting and that the recording is shared   with   each   other   after   the   meeting. 
ii. Requirement: You must   switch   on   the   camera   during   the   meeting.   You   must   also   use the share screen function. You must   record   the   meeting. When   using   the template, the ‘technology’ will include all the   features   involved   during the   call.
iii. Advice:   Discuss with your teammates which team meeting   you   will   use   to
document this activity.   Select one person as the   host who   creates   and   shares   the   zoom link with the others. The host   is   most likely   the   person   recording   the meeting.
iv. The task:   Document your interactions   and   experiences   onto   the journal   template.   Individuals must provide the link to   the meeting’s   recording
v. Submission date:   before   your   tutorial   on   Week   7
5.      TEMPLATE
You   must   use   the   template   to   write   your   journal   entry. The   template   provides   guides   with headings to ensure that you include all the necessary aspects when describing user experiences. Take your time to understand the different sections of   the template and what 代 写31777 | 32509 Advanced Interaction Design ASSIGNMENT 1SQL
代做程序编程语言  is expected   of   you   from   each   of   the   headings. Add   more   rows   to   the   table   as   needed.   Most   of    all, think carefully about the best way to tell your ‘story’ of   what happened and your use experience   of   the   technology.
You will get opportunities to try out the   journal template during tutorial Week   1   and 2.   You   will   also   see   a   sample   of   a   completed   journal.
You will receive feedback for   Journal   1 before submitting Journal 2.   The   feedback   from Journal   1 can be used to help you improve your Journal 2. Each   journal is worth   10 marks.   There   will   be   a   video   presentation   to   explain   the   sample   journal   and   the   journal   template 
Including supporting materials 
Appropriate supporting materials such as sketches, annotated   diagrams, pictures,   etc.,   can   help   support   the   clarity   and   accuracy   of   your   written   descriptions.   When   used   well,   they allow the reader to gain a deeper sense or   even   empathise with your   experience.   When including these visual materials, it is important to annotate them carefully   and   descriptively   to help the reader understand why the material is included.
